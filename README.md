## ðŸ“Œ Guidelines

* **Academic integrity**: Cheating is not tolerated. Code must not be copied, shared, or transferred in any way. Use of LLMs (e.g. ChatGPT) is encouraged, but you are fully responsible for verifying correctness. Prompts and generated code should not be shared between students.

* **Submission format**: Submit a `.zip` file named `HWx_ID1_ID2.zip` containing two items:

  1. `src/` directory with all code, including a `main.py` file that can reproduce your results. No need to submit data or trained models.
  2. `report_ID1_ID2.pdf` â€“ your written concise report, according to each HW requirments

* **Assignments**: There are two planned homework assignments (Regression and Neural Networks) and one final project.

* **Grading**: Based on both code correctness and clarity, and the quality of the written report.

* **Homework support**: All questions must be posted in the relevant Moodle forum. Forum answers are considered official clarificationsâ€”review them before submission.

* **Appeals & personal issues**: May be sent directly to the TA by email.
